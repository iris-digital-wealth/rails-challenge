## Code Challenge

This repository contains the code challenge to become a Iris DW full stack engineer.

### Our philosophy

The initial design for a system or component is almost never the best one. Experience inevitably shows better ways to do things. As a software developer, you should always be on the lookout for opportunities to improve the design of the system you are working on, and you should plan on spending some fraction of your time on design improvements. You should always be thinking about reducing complexity which is the most important element of software design. In addition to that, do not forget to always leave the campground cleaner than you found it.

### Remote

We fully embrace the remote work. Our team is 100% remote with developers based in Brazil and Canada. 
In your day-to-day job, you will be involved in problem solving, programming, code review and testing. 

### The challenge

Rails-challenge is a simple multi-tenancy rails application using Apartament gem that contains a rough code and few bugs. You need to refactor and implement a straightforward feature as you will see in the exercise section.

#### Exercise

1. Fork this repository
2. Refactor the controller contacts
3. Add a new feature using ActionCable: when a new contact is added/updated/deleted, everbody in the same page must see the updates in realtime

Piece of cake, eh?

### After submission

Once submitted, our team will review your code in order to evaluate the proposed solution. This process might take around one week to be completed. You will receive a feedback on your evaluation, and based on your solution we will invite you for an online meeting.

### Rules

#### You can:

1. Create and move the code between new modules, classes or methods
2. Completely re-write the current syntax
3. Change the current database by modifying or adding new tables


#### You cannot:

1. add a new dependency
3. change the current funcionality or any url


### What we look for

1. Straightforward: write clean and concise code that any developer can read and understand
2. Well-thought-out solutions over quick and dirty code. Take your time to think in the best way to solve a problem instead just shipping any solution


### Setup

Clone this repository and start the application by running `docker-compose up`.
